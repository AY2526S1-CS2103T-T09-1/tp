HeartLink helps you **spend less time navigating** menus and **more time focusing** on what matters: ***your clients***.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines 
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### 8. Looking up appointments by fields `find`

Here is the second part of `find` command specific for appointments.
[Click here](#7-looking-up-clients-by-fields-find) to go back to the first part for finding by client!

Format:
```
find [appt/DATE [TIME]] [status/STATUS] [type/TYPE]

[Back to list of attributes](#heres-the-list-of-attributes-for-appointment)

#### iv. Chaining commands
It is possible to chain these fields with [client fields](#7-look-up-clients-by-fields-find).

Example:
* `find r/urgent appt/today`
This command allows you to find today's appointment for urgent clients

> Although the leading command to list appointments and clients is the same, the behavior differs depending on the fields provided.
If you include any appointment-related fields, such as `appt/`, `status/`, or `type/`, the system will list appointments.
However, providing client-related fields alone only trigger a client listing view instead.
For example,
> - `find r/urgent` will show list of all clients with their respective appointments.
> - `find r/urgent appt/today` will only show list of appointments.
>
> The order of the attributes does not matter. If you haven't specified any attributes, the system will list all clients.

**Expected Output:**
```
X appointments listed!
```
The address book lists all appointments that fits the specified constraints.

### Other features:

### Saving the data

HeartLink data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

HeartLink data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If you are familiar with JSON, you are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file! <br>
However, do note that if the changes make the format invalid(e.g. values out of range, missing field), HeartLink will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. 
Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
</div>

### Appointment clashes
If you attempt to create or edit an appointment with a confirmed status, you may encounter appointment clashes. 
Two appointments clash when:
- Both appointments are set to the confirmed status. 
- Both appointments are for the same client.
- Both appointments have overlapping timings.

HeartLink does not allow this to happen, and you will get an error message. 
For example, suppose that your current address book is as follows.
```json
{
  "persons" : [
    {
      "name": "Alex Yeoh",
      "appointments": [
        {
          "id": "e271471",
          "dateTime": "24-10-2025 1100",
          "length": "30",
          "status": "confirmed"
        },
        {
          "id": "e125428",
          "dateTime": "24-10-2025 1120",
          "length": "30",
          "status": "planned"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Note that the appointment `e271471` and `e125428` do not clash because one of the appointments are
not confirmed.
If you execute the command:`link -c n/Alex Yeoh appt/24-10-2025 1030 len/30 status/confirmed`, 
you will receive an error message because the time slot `1100 - 1130` overlaps with `1030-1100`.
```
Two confirmed appointments clash. 
[old: e271471] 24-10-2025 1100
[new] 24-10-2025 1030
```
Similarly, if you attempt to change appointment status in `e125428` to `confirmed`, you still got the error.
```
Two confirmed appointments clash. 
[old: e271471] 24-10-2025 1100
[new: e125428] 24-10-2025 1120
```

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Follow the steps below:
1. Install the app in the other computer, say computer B.
2. On both computers, navigate to the folder with HeartLink. 
3. Navigate to a folder named `data` and you will see a file called `addressbook.json` <br> 
(If you don't see it in computer B, you can either run HeartLink once or create the file manually)
4. Copy the contents of `addressbook.json` file from computer A (where your data is) to computer B.
