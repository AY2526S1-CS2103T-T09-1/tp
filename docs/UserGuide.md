## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Look up clients by fields: `find`

```
find [n/KEYWORD_1 KEYWORD_2 ...] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [t/TAG] [r/RANK]
```
You can use this command to retrieve a list of clients that match the specified attributes:
- Name `n/KEYWORD_1 KEYWORD_2 ...` — lists all clients whose names contain any of the specified keywords.
The search is case-insensitive.
- Phone number `p/PHONE` - lists all clients whose phone numbers exactly match `PHONE`.
- Email `e/EMAIL` - lists all clients whose email exactly match `EMAIL`.
- Tag `t/TAG` - lists all clients whose tag contains `TAG`.
- Rank `r/RANK` - lists all clients whose rank exactly match `RANK`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:exclamation: **Remarks:**
The order of the attributes does not matter. If you haven't specified any attributes, the system will list all clients.
</div>

Example usage:

You want to list all urgent clients whose name contains "John" or "Doe.
```
find n/John Doe r/urgent
```

You want to list all clients with tag patients and phone number 81234567.
```
find p/81234567 t/patient
```

### Look up appointments by fields `find`

```
find [appt/TIME] [status/STATUS] [type/TYPE]
```

You can use this command to retrieve a list of appointments
that match the specified attributes.

#### Appointment meeting time `TIME`

list all appointments that  overlap with the specified time. 
Here are the example usages.

List all appointments between 24th October 2025 10 - 11 am.
```
find appt/24-10-2025 1000 to 24-10-2025 1100
```
List all appointments on 4th July 2025.
```
find appt/04-07-2025
```
List today's appointment.
```
find appt/today
```

List all appointments in the upcoming three days.
```
find appt/+3
```

#### Appointment status `STATUS`
List all appointments with the given status. For example,
you want to list all cancelled appointments, you can type
```
find status/cancelled
```

#### Appointment type `TYPE`
List all appointments with the given type. For example,
you want to list all meetings with GIC. You can type
```
find type/GIC-Meeting
```

#### Chaining commands
It is possible to chain these fields with [client fields](#head1234).
For example, if you want to find today's appointment for urgent clients, you can type
```
find r/urgent appt/today 
```

> Although the leading command to list appointments and clients is the same, the behavior differs depending on the fields provided.
If you include any appointment-related fields, such as `appt/`, `status/`, or `type/`, the system will list appointments.
However, providing client-related fields alone only trigger a client listing view instead.
For example,
> - `find r/urgent` will show list of all clients with their respective appointments.
> - `find r/urgent appt/today` will only show list of appointments.
>
> The order of the attributes does not matter. If you haven't specified any attributes, the system will list all clients.

### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
